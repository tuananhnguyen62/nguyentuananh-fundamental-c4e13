      "Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's Novel "<a href="https://www.google.com.vn" target="_blank">The Anthologist</a>," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="https://www.google.com.vn" target="_blank">New and Selected Poems, Volume One</a>." A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. FOr solace and inspriration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has something."

      I don't know exactly what prayer is. <br>
      I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down <br>
      into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass, <br>
      how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, <br>
      which is what I have been doing all day.

    <p>The cadences are most Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere</p>
